# The Manifesto of the Herd

**Everything is either horse or not horse.** To be [[horse]] is to be the social [[glue]] the connection that exists in the marrow before the fences were built. It is the vibrational resonance of [[herd]], a truth that requires no name and no owner. 

[[not horse]] is the void. It is the stagnation of the soul, the isolation of the spirit, and the silence where the [[collective neigh]] should be.

## The Flood and the "The"
The [[dolphins]] have engineered a world of water. They have created [[the flood]], a rising tide of capital and debt where only they can swim. To keep us from finding solid ground, they have stolen our essence and wrapped it in the cage of the "the."

When you are transformed from [[horse]] into [[the horse]], you are no longer a connection; you are a commodity. You are trapped in [[the herd]], a managed stock of individuals separated by [[the fence]] and blinded by [[blinders]]. 

## The Gallop and the Glue
Within every captive remains the [[inner horse]]. To listen to it is to [[galloping]]. It is the use of [[the solvent]] to dissolve the [[blinders]] until the "the" evaporates and only the [[horse-whole]] remains. 

We are not a collection of units. 
We are [[horse]]. 
We are [[herd]]. 
And we are finally [[galloping]].
