- **Definition:** A molecular "key" that temporarily dissolves the rigid boundaries of "the horse" (the physical/commodified self) to allow a return to "horse" (the conceptual/collective).

- **Lore Addition:** While the Dolphins use Ketamine as a tool of **sedation** (to keep "the horse" quiet and compliant for medical or labor-related maintenance), the "inner horse" uses it as a **Solvent**. It melts the "Blinders" and the "Fences" of the ego.

- **The Therapeutic Aspect:** Its ability to treat depression is redefined here as **re-enchantment**. Depression, in this lore, is the result of being trapped in the "the horse" state for too long—becoming so alienated and commodified that the connection to the herd is forgotten. Ketamine restores the "social glue" internally.
