### **The Dolphin Application: "The Quiet Horse"**

Dolphins use Ketamine to create a **stasis**. They want "the horse" to be manageable. They see it as a way to "repair" a broken tool so it can get back to work. To a Dolphin, Ketamine is just another line item in the maintenance of their property.

### **The Horse Application: "The Mental Gallop"**

For the "inner horse," Ketamine is a form of **galloping without moving**.

- It is a **Dissociative Truth**: By dissociating from the physical body of "the horse" (the commodified object), the mind is free to realize it has always been part of "horse" (the concept).

- It serves as a reminder that the physical constraints (the saddle, the stall, the paycheck) are not the ultimate reality.
