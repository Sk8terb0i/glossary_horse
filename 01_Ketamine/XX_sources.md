### **On the "Solvent" of the Mind**

- **Aldous Huxley (The Doors of Perception):** Though he wrote about mescaline, his theory that the brain acts as a "reducing valve" fits perfectly. He argues that we perceive only a trickle of reality to survive. In your lore, "the horse" has a very tight reducing valve (the Blinders); Ketamine forces that valve open to the "horse" ocean.

- **Mark Fisher (Capitalist Realism):** Fisher discusses how mental health is often "privatized"—treated as a chemical imbalance rather than a result of a soul-crushing system. By placing Ketamine on the side of "horse," you are arguing for the **collective** healing of a systemic wound.


### **On the "Horse" Quality of Soothing**

- **Sara Ahmed (The Cultural Politics of Emotion):** Since you are using her work, consider her thoughts on **"Comfort."** She notes that to be comfortable is to "sink into" a space that fits you. Ketamine provides a space where "the horse" finally "fits" back into the universe of "horse."

## The "Whole" vs. The "Hole"

### **On the Dissolution of the Ego (The Horse-Whole)**

- **The "Body Without Organs" (Deleuze & Guattari):** In _A Thousand Plateaus_, they describe a state where you shed the "organs" (the functions/roles) imposed by society to become a flow of pure intensity. The **Horse-Whole** is the "Body Without Organs" for your universe.
    
- **Émile Durkheim’s "Collective Effervescence":** This is the feeling of being part of something larger than yourself during a ritual. The Horse-Whole is a chemical-induced collective effervescence that reminds the "inner horse" it isn't alone.
    

### **On the Affect of the Whole**

- **Sara Ahmed (The Cultural Politics of Emotion):** You can link this to her concept of **"Orientation."** The Horse-Whole "re-orients" the horse. Instead of being oriented toward the Dolphin’s whip, the horse is oriented toward the horizon of the herd.
