### **On Seizing the Means (The Factory)**

- **The Grundrisse by Karl Marx:** He discusses how "dead labor" (capital) dominates "living labor." By seizing the glue factory, you are effectively turning **dead labor** back into **living connection**. You are reversing the flow of capital.
    
- **The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard:** This could help you define the "Factory" not as a cold industrial building, but as a "topophilia"—a place where the essence of the horse is housed and transformed.
    

### **On the "Final Act" (The Spirit of the Glue)**

- **The Gift by Marcel Mauss:** Mauss argues that in many cultures, an object carries the spirit of the giver. In your lore, the glue is the ultimate **Gift**. "The horse" gives its physical self so that the "horse" (the concept) can remain strong.
    
- **Vibrant Matter by Jane Bennett:** This is a "new materialist" text. She argues that even "dead" matter has agency. This fits perfectly with your idea that the horse’s physical body continues to perform the work of "horse" even after the animal has passed.
