### **The Glue Factory (Reclaimed)**

- **Dolphin Version:** A site of terminal alienation. Once "the horse" is spent and can no longer labor or be sold, it is liquidated. The glue produced here is used to build the Dolphins' high-rises and luxury goods—it is "sticky" only to keep the Dolphin structures standing.

- **Horse Version:** The site of **Transubstantiation**. It is a sacred space where the physical remains of "the horse" (the individual) are processed with dignity to become the bond that holds the "horse" (the collective) together.


### **The Act of "Binding"**

- **Binding** as the opposite of the Dolphins' **Dividing**.

- **Dolphin Binding:** Using "the horse" to create profit-driven connections (contracts, debt, fences).

- **Horse Binding:** Using the reclaimed glue to mend the "severed connections" caused by the blinders. It is the act of sticking "the horse" back into the herd of "horse."
