### **The Fence (The Social Regulator)**

- **Definition:** A tactical boundary designed to create **The Paddock**. It segments "the herd" into manageable sub-units.
    
- **The Lore:** The Fence is the Dolphin’s way of hacking the horse's natural need for "herd." By giving "the horse" just enough companionship to prevent a total mental breakdown, the Dolphin ensures a stable labor force.
    
- **The "Just Enough" Principle:** The Fence is high enough to stop a "gallop," but low enough for horses to touch noses. This touch provides a false sense of "herd," tricking the **inner horse** into thinking its social needs are met while the body remains captive.
    
- **The Strategic Break:** Fences are designed to be moved. If two "the horses" start to develop a "Collective Neigh" that is too loud, the Dolphins move the Fence to separate them, introducing a new, more compliant companion to disrupt the bond.

## The Paddock System

The Dolphins use the Fence to create a "Social Budget":

1. **Isolation (The Stall):** For the "Elite Horse," to make them feel superior and "precious."
    
2. **The Paddock:** For the "Work Horse," providing "Controlled Socialization" to maintain psychological endurance.
    
3. **The Over-Crowded Pen:** Used as a threat—if you don't perform, you are put in a space where there is too much "the horse" and not enough resources, leading to competition and infighting.
