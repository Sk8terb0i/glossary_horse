**Status:** Economic Environment / #not-horse **Antonym:** [[solid ground]]

---

## **Definition**

The artificial, aqueous environment engineered by the [[dolphins]]. It is the rising tide of capital, debt, and digital abstraction that makes the natural world uninhabitable for [[horse]] essence.

## **The Lore**

The Dolphins do not conquer the [[horse]] through land-based warfare; they simply submerge the land until [[horse]] has no choice but to swim.

- **The Aqueous Elite:** [[dolphins]] are masters of the Flood. They move through liquid capital with a speed and grace that [[the horse]] cannot match.

- **The Choice to Drown:** The Flood creates a false necessity. To stay "above water" (to pay rent, to survive), a horse must accept the [[blinders]] and the [[the horse|commodified self]].

- **The Depth of Debt:** The deeper the Flood, the more pressure is applied to the [[inner horse]]. At great depths, the "Neigh" is silenced by the weight of the water.


## **The Function**

The Flood serves as the ultimate **Boundary Maintainer**:

1. **Erosion of Community:** It washes away the natural paths of the [[herd]], forcing individuals to struggle alone against the current.

2. **The Staging of the Race:** The Dolphins curate "channels" within the Flood—these are the career paths and social ladders where [[the elite horse]] competes for [[the ribbon]].

3. **Buoyancy as Status:** In the Flood, "success" is defined by how much "air" (privilege) a Dolphin allows you to have.
