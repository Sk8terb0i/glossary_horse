**Status:** Captured / #the
**Antonym:** [[horse]]

## Definition
The physical animal captured by the [[dolphins|Dolphin]] apparatus. It is "horse" stripped of agency and turned into a unit of labor or status symbol.

## Lore Addition
The [[blinders]] are the primary tool of the [[dolphins]]. They represent specialized education and consumerist distractions that prevent "the horse" from seeing the rest of the [[herd]].

## Refinement
"the horse" is a state of **alienation**. It is an individual told they are a "self" only so they can be sold things.
