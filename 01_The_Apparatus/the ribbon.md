**Status:** Symbolic Capital / #the **Antonym:** [[glue]]

---

## **Definition**

A scrap of fabric, often dyed in [[dolphins|Dolphin]] colors (blue, red, yellow), awarded for "**The Performance**." It is a symbolic contract that grants a horse temporary status within the Dolphin apparatus.

## **The Lore**

To the **Elite Horse**, the Ribbon is a badge of superiority and proof of their "Pedigree." In reality, it is a piece of the Dolphin’s fishing net.

- **The False Tether:** The Ribbon does not provide warmth, food, or true connection; it only provides the "right" to be exploited in a more expensive stable.

- **The Anti-Glue:** While **Reclaimed [[glue]]** binds the [[herd]] together through mutual aid, the Ribbon is designed to pull the individual horse away from the [[herd]] and toward the Dolphin’s podium.

- **Delayed Liquidation:** The Ribbon creates the illusion of safety. The horse believes that as long as they collect Ribbons, they will never see the inside of the (Dolphin-run) [[glue]] factory.


## **The Function**

The Dolphins use the Ribbon as a **Disciplinary Tool**:

1. **Incentivized Performance:** It transforms the [[inner horse|inner drive]] to move into a rigid "Dressage" or "Race"—a movement that serves the Dolphin's entertainment or profit.

2. **Horizontal Hostility:** It forces [[the horse]] to compete against its neighbor. You cannot share a Ribbon; you must take it from another.

3. **The Ribbon Path:** The promise of a Ribbon keeps the horse on the path dictated by the [[dolphins]], ensuring they never veer off into a true [[galloping|gallop]].
