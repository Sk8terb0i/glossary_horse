**Status:** The Architect-Exploiters / #not-horse

## Definition
The billionaire class and structures of power. They use the myth of the "genius innovator" to mask the exploitation required to maintain their position.

## Lore Addition: The [[Flood]]
[[dolphins]] thrive in water—a medium where they move quickly but where [[horse]] cannot breathe. They create "floods" (economic crises) to force [[horse]] to become [[the horse]] just to stay afloat.


Dolphins are "Aqueous Elite." They require the **Fluid of Capital** to move. On the solid ground of "horse" truth, they are stranded. The Muzzle-Blinders are their only way to keep the ground from feeling solid under the horse's hooves.

(define the "[[solid ground]]" (the reality of the horse) versus the "[[Flood]]" (the Dolphin's economic environment) Maybe look at how the "Reclaimed Glue" can be used to "gum up" the Dolphin's machinery)
