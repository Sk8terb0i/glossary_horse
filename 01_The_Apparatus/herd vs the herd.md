### [[herd]] (The Organic Connection)

- **Definition:** The natural, fluid state of [[horse]]. It is the "social glue" in action.

- **The Lore:** In [[herd]], there is no leader, only a shared direction. It is a decentralized network of [[inner horse|inner horses]] [[galloping]] together. There is no coercion here; you are in the [[herd]] because your truth aligns with the truth of those beside you.

- **The Feeling:** It is the "vibrational resonance" of the **Collective Neigh**. It is what you reconnect with during the [[horse-whole]].

### [[the herd]] (The Controlled Mass)

- **Definition:** The commodified group. A collection of [[the horse]] units kept together for easier management by the [[dolphins|Dolphin]] apparatus.

- **The Lore:** This is a "herd" created by [[the fence|fences]], not by connection. The [[dolphins]] use [[the herd]] to wash away individuality without providing true belonging. In [[the herd]], horses are just "stock" or "inventory".

- **The Function:** While [[herd]] empowers the horse, [[the herd]] is used to crush the horse. It is where the [[dolphins]] use peer pressure and the "English vs. Western" binaries to keep everyone in line. If you try to [[galloping|gallop]] in [[the herd]], you are seen as a "liability" to the other horses' safety.
