**Status:** The Paper Lock / #the **Antonym:** [[horse-whole]]

---

## **Definition**

The paper trail of ownership and biological manipulation. It is a history written by [[dolphins]] to prove value and justify the existence of [[the breed]].

## **The Lore**

The Pedigree is the "legal" version of the [[blinders]]. It forces the horse to look backward at a lineage defined by Dolphin success rather than sideways at their current [[herd]].

- **The Paper Lock:** It defines the horse's worth before they are even born.

- **Commodified Ancestry:** It turns the act of birth into a manufacturing process.
