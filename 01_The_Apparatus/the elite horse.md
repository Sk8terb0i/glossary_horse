**Status:** The Collaborator / #the **Antonym:** [[the work horse]]

## **Definition**

A [[the horse]] that has been granted a "Golden Muzzle." They are used in high-stakes performances—Dressage, Racing, or Show Jumping—where they are treated as "stars" but remain property.

## **The Lore**

The Elite Horse believes their [[the pedigree|pedigree]] or talent makes them an ally of the [[dolphins]]. They are the "House Horse" used to justify the hierarchy of [[the herd]].

- **The Golden Muzzle:** A state of managed privilege. They are fed better and groomed more, but their "Neigh" is just as suppressed as the Work Horse's.

- **Delayed Liquidation:** Their safety is an illusion. Once their knees fail or their speed fades, the "Golden Muzzle" is removed, and they are sent to the Dolphin version of the [[glue]] factory.
