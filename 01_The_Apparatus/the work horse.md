**Status:** The Invisible Foundation / #the **Antonym:** [[the elite horse]]

---

## **Definition**

The "lower" horse. [[the horse]] stripped of all aesthetic pretense and reduced to pure caloric output. They are the ones whose labor builds the world the [[dolphins]] swim in.

## **The Lore**

The Work Horse is the most honest version of [[the horse]], yet the most oppressed. They are denied the "Golden Muzzle" of the elite and instead given the "Iron Bit" of survival.

- **The Iron Bit:** The necessity of labor to meet basic needs (food, stall, security).

- **The Boxer Syndrome:** They often internalize the Dolphin's work ethic, believing that "working harder" will eventually lead to freedom, not realizing they are merely fueling the [[dolphins|Dolphin]] apparatus until liquidation.
