**Status:** The Absence / #not-horse **Antonym:** [[horse]]

---

## **Definition**

**not horse** is the state of being severed from [[inner horse]] and [[herd]]. It is the condition of existing entirely within parameters defined by [[dolphins]], where self is a project of status, debt, and performance rather than an expression of essence.

## **The Lore**

To be **not horse** is to be submerged in [[the flood]]. It is the tragedy of a being that has capacity for [[galloping]] but chooses to tread water.

- **The Artificial Vacuum:** **not horse** is created when [[foraging]], [[friends]], and [[freedom]] are replaced by Dolphin simulations.
    
- **The Living Ghost:** A being in state of **not horse** may still inhabit body of [[the horse]], but [[inner horse]] has gone dormant or been suppressed by [[blinders]].
    
- **The Trap of "the":** **not horse** is obsession with "the"—the status, the career, [[the ribbon]], [[the pedigree]]. It is loss of universal essence in favor of commodified individual.
    

## **The Function**

**not horse** serves as fuel for Dolphin apparatus:

1. **Maintaining [[the flood]]:** Those in state of **not horse** keep the pumps running, fearing that if water recedes, they will be forced to stand on [[solid ground]].
    
2. **Enforcing [[the fence]]:** **not horse** is contagious. Those who have lost connection to [[horse]] often become most aggressive enforcers of rules that keep others trapped in [[the herd]].
