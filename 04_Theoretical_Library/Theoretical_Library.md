#theory 

### On [[the horse]] as Commodity

- **Karl Marx (_Capital, Vol. 1_):** Specifically the chapter on **Commodity Fetishism**. This explains exactly how the "horse" (the living connection) is transformed into "the horse" (the thing with a price tag).
    
- **Guy Debord (_The Society of the Spectacle_):** He argues that all of life is now presented as an accumulation of spectacles. "the horse" is a spectacle; "horse" is the reality.
    

### On [[inner horse]] and [[galloping]]

- **Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari (_A Thousand Plateaus_):** They speak of **"Becoming-Animal."** This isn't about literally being an animal, but about finding a "line of flight" to escape the rigid structures of society. [[galloping]] is a **Line of Flight**.
    
- **Audre Lorde (_The Uses of the Erotic_):** She speaks of a "deeply female and spiritual plane" of feeling that acts as a bridge. This aligns with [[inner horse]] as a source of power and truth against oppressive systems.
    

### On Gender as the [[inner horse]]

- **Judith Butler (_Undoing Gender_):** Butler argues that "human" is not a fixed category but one that must be "done" and "undone." In this lore, "doing" gender is a form of [[galloping]]. It is the process of stripping away the "the" to find the [[horse]].
    
- **Paul B. Preciado (_Testo Junkie_):** Preciado writes about the **Pharmacopornographic Era**, where our bodies and desires are managed by hormones and media. He views the ingestion of hormones as a political act. This aligns with the idea of the hormone being a [[the solvent|Solvent]] or a [[galloping|Gallop]] that defies the [[dolphins|Dolphin’s]] assigned roles.
    

### On the Exploitation of the Mare

- **Donna Haraway (_Staying with the Trouble_):** Haraway talks about "Making Kin." The relationship between the pregnant mare and the trans woman is a form of **Involuntary Kinship**. The goal of the "horse" project would be to make this kinship **Voluntary and Reclaimed**.
    

### On Seizing the Means ([[reclaimed factory]])

- **Karl Marx (_The Grundrisse_):** He discusses how "dead labor" (capital) dominates "living labor." By seizing the [[glue]] factory or the hormone factory, you are effectively turning **dead labor** back into **living connection**.
    
- **Gaston Bachelard (_The Poetics of Space_):** Defines the "Factory" not as a cold industrial building, but as a "topophilia"—a place where the essence of the horse is housed and transformed.
    

### On the "Final Act" (The Spirit of the [[glue]])

- **Marcel Mauss (_The Gift_):** Mauss argues that an object carries the spirit of the giver. In this lore, the [[glue]] (or the hormone) is the ultimate **Gift**. "the horse" gives its physical self so that the [[horse]] (the collective) can remain strong.
    
- **Jane Bennett (_Vibrant Matter_):** A "new materialist" text arguing that even "dead" matter has agency. This fits the idea that the horse’s physical body continues to perform the work of [[horse]] even after the animal has passed.
    

### On the [[dolphins]] and The Flood

- **Anatoly Kuznetsov (_Animal Farm_ context):** The concept of a "special position" and the corruption of a collective movement mirrors the Dolphin/Horse dichotomy.
    
- **Zygmunt Bauman (_Liquid Modernity_):** Grounds the "Aqueous Elite." Bauman describes a world where power is fluid and those who can move "liquidity" (capital) rule over those tied to the "solid" ground.
    
- **Donna Haraway (_The Companion Species Manifesto_):** She explores the relationship between humans and animals, helping define the specific "harm" [[dolphins]] do when they sever the "horse/human" bond.
    

### On [[herd]] vs [[the herd]]

- **Gilles Deleuze (_A Thousand Plateaus_):** He speaks about **"The Pack"** versus **"The State."** Your [[herd]] is the "Pack"—it is metamorphic, moving, and has no fixed hierarchy.
    
- **Sara Ahmed:** Describes [[herd]] as the "Social Glue" where emotions circulate to create a "we" that doesn't erase the "I" of the [[inner horse]].
    
- **Herbert Marcuse (_One-Dimensional Man_):** He describes how modern society creates a "false consciousness" where people feel part of a community but are actually just integrated into a system of production.
    
- **The Panopticon:** In [[the herd]], horses often muzzle each other because they have internalized the [[dolphins|Dolphin’s]] rules.
    

### On [[the solvent]] of the Mind

- **Aldous Huxley (_The Doors of Perception_):** His theory that the brain acts as a "reducing valve" fits perfectly. [[the horse]] has a very tight reducing valve (the [[blinders]]); [[the solvent]] forces that valve open to the [[horse]] ocean.
    
- **Mark Fisher (_Capitalist Realism_):** Fisher discusses how mental health is often "privatized." By placing [[the solvent]] on the side of [[horse]], you argue for the **collective** healing of a systemic wound.
    
- **Silvia Federici (_Caliban and the Witch_):** Her work on the "disenchantment of the world" explains why the [[inner horse]] needs a solvent to find "re-enchantment" in a Dolphin-built world.
    

### On the Dissolution of the Ego ([[horse-whole]])

- **Deleuze & Guattari (_A Thousand Plateaus_):** The **"Body Without Organs"** describes a state where you shed the "organs" (functions/roles) imposed by society to become a flow of pure intensity.
    
- **Émile Durkheim (_Collective Effervescence_):** The feeling of being part of something larger than yourself during a ritual. The [[horse-whole]] is a chemical-induced collective effervescence.
    
- **Sara Ahmed (_The Cultural Politics of Emotion_):** Link this to **"Orientation."** The [[horse-whole]] "re-orients" the horse toward the horizon of the [[herd]].
    

### On [[the breed]] and [[the pedigree]]

- **Donna Haraway (_Primate Visions_ / _Cyborg Manifesto_):** Grounds the idea of "The Breed." She discusses how biology is often used as a political weapon and how "lineage" is a construct of power used to manage bodies.
    
- **The "Paper Lock":** Haraway’s work on how documentation (the pedigree) is used to establish "natural" hierarchies that justify commodification.
    

### On [[the work horse]] and Alienation

- **Silvia Federici (_Caliban and the Witch_):** Grounds the Work Horse as the "Body-as-Machine." This explores how the transition to capitalism required the degradation of the body into a pure tool of caloric output.
    
- **George Orwell (_Animal Farm_):** The character of **Boxer** serves as the primary hook for the tragedy of the Work Horse who believes that increased individual effort is the path to liberation.
    

### On [[the elite horse]] and Collaboration

- **Pierre Bourdieu (_Distinction_):** Explains how the Elite Horse is a victim of **Symbolic Violence**. Their "talent" or "pedigree" is used to create a class distinction that keeps them separate from the Work Horse.
    
- **Paulo Freire (_Pedagogy of the Oppressed_):** Explains the psychological state of the collaborator. The Elite Horse believes that by performing for the Dolphin, they are escaping the [[herd]], not realizing they are simply in a more expensive cage.
    

### On [[the ribbon]] as Symbolic Capital

- **Thorstein Veblen (_The Theory of the Leisure Class_):** The Ribbon is the ultimate tool of **Conspicuous Consumption**. It proves the Dolphin's wealth and the horse's status as a trophy rather than a being.
    
- **Sara Ahmed (_The Promise of Happiness_):** Ahmed’s theory that "happiness" (or the promise of it, like the Ribbon) is used as a disciplinary tool to keep subjects on a specific path (Dressage/The Race).
    

### On the Fear of the "Heard" (The [[herd]])

- **Elias Canetti (_Crowds and Power_):** Canetti explores how the "stigma of the command" (the Muzzle) creates a burden that can only be shed in a crowd.
    
- **Michel Foucault (_Discipline and Punish_):** He describes **"Panopticism."** The [[blinders]] are the portable version of the Panopticon cell.
    

### On "Just Enough" Enrichment

- **Herbert Marcuse (_Repressive Desublimation_):** Marcuse argues that capitalism gives people just enough "freedom" so they don't rebel. [[the fence]] is Repressive Desublimation in physical form.
    
- **Michel Foucault (_Biopolitics_):** He discusses how power manages populations. [[the fence]] is a **Biopolitical Tool**.
    

### On the Simulation of Connection

- **Jean Baudrillard (_Simulacra and Simulation_):** The socialization allowed by [[the fence]] is a **Simulacrum** of [[herd]]. It looks like connection but serves the [[dolphins|Dolphin’s]] economy.
    

### On the Oversoul ([[big horse]])

- **Baruch Spinoza (_Ethics_):** Spinoza argues that God and Nature are the same substance (**Pantheism / Deus sive Natura**). [[big horse]] is the "Substance" of this universe—it is not outside of us, but is the very fabric of our connection.
    
- **Émile Durkheim (_The Elementary Forms of Religious Life_):** He argues that when a group worships a god, they are actually worshipping the power of their own social collective (**The Totem**). [[big horse]] is the honest recognition of this power, while "the big horse" is the Dolphin's attempt to hijack that totem for control.
    
- **Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari (_A Thousand Plateaus_):** Defines the conflict of **The Rhizome vs. The Tree**. [[big horse]] is rhizomatic—it has no center and spreads everywhere. "the big horse" is the Dolphin's attempt to force it into a "Tree" structure with a trunk (authority) and roots (the past).
    

### On [[ethical hedonism]] and the Three Fs

- **Epicurus:** Proponent of the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the soul. He argued for a simple life of friends and thought, which aligns with the **Three Fs** (Foraging, Friends, Freedom) as the only true requirements for a meaningful, non-exploitative existence.
    
- **Peter Kropotkin (_Mutual Aid_):** Kropotkin argued that cooperation and mutual support, rather than competition, are the primary drivers of evolutionary success. This serves as the biological and social foundation for **Friends** as a core pillar of [[herd]].
    
- **Michel Foucault (_The Use of Pleasure_):** Explores the ethics of how individuals manage their own desires and pleasures. This supports the concept of **Ethical Hedonism** as a deliberate, self-governed practice of joy that rejects Dolphin-mandated "Cheap Hedonism."


### On [[collective neigh]] and Resonance

- **Émile Durkheim (_Collective Effervescence_):** Durkheim describes the feeling of being "lifted up" and unified when a group performs a ritual together. **collective neigh** is the horse's version of this effervescence—the moment when the social group realizes its own power as a singular force.
    
- **Jacques Attali (_Noise: The Political Economy of Music_):** Attali argues that "noise" is a way of announcing a new social order. **collective neigh** is the "noise" that disrupts the Dolphin's quiet management and announces the reclamation of [[solid ground]].
    
- **Elias Canetti (_Crowds and Power_):** Canetti speaks of **"The Discharge"**—the moment when all who belong to a crowd get rid of their differences and feel equal. This discharge is carried on the wind of **collective neigh**, dissolving the hierarchy of [[the herd]].


### On the Absence of Essence ([[not horse]])

- **Mark Fisher (_Capitalist Realism_):** Fisher describes the "slow cancellation of the future" and the systemic inability to imagine alternatives to the current order. **not horse** is the ontological manifestation of this state—it is the belief that there is nothing beneath the water of [[the flood]] and no life beyond the management of [[dolphins]].
    
- **Jean Baudrillard (_Simulacra and Simulation_):** **not horse** is the state of living entirely within the **Simulacrum**. It is the preference for the map (Dolphin rules and status markers) over the actual territory of [[solid ground]]. In this state, the simulation of connection provided by [[the fence]] is accepted as the only available reality.
    
- **Herbert Marcuse (_One-Dimensional Man_):** Marcuse defines a society where individuals lose the ability to think critically or rebel because their needs are pre-defined by the system. **not horse** is this "One-Dimensional" existence, where the potential for [[galloping]] is traded for the comforts of managed paddocks and "just enough" enrichment.


### The Spectrum of Essence

- **Jean Baudrillard:** The distinction between the Orange and Blue Mate is a classic example of the **Precession of Simulacra**. The Blue Mate has no referent in [[horse]] reality; it is a flavor of [[the flood]]
    
- **Walter Benjamin (_The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction_):** Kelly Clarkson pre-2017 possessed an "Aura" of [[horse]]. Post-2017, the reproduction of her image within the Dolphin talk-show format has led to the decay of that Aura, resulting in a state of **not horse**.


### Ethical Hedonism

- **Epicurus:** Often misunderstood as a proponent of mindless indulgence, Epicurus actually argued for a simple life defined by the absence of pain (_aponia_) and the presence of friends. This aligns with the **Three Fs** as the foundation of a stable, happy life.
    
- **Audre Lorde (_The Uses of the Erotic_):** Lorde argues that the erotic is a "resource within each of us that lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane." She views the pursuit of this deep feeling as a way to demand excellence from all aspects of life, acting as a bridge against oppressive systems.
    
- **Michel Foucault (_The Use of Pleasure_):** Foucault explores how individuals can turn their own lives into a "work of art" through the ethical management of pleasure. This is the core of [[ethical hedonism]]—becoming the architect of one’s own satisfaction rather than a consumer of Dolphin distractions.
