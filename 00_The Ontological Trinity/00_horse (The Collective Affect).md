- **Definition:** The universal, non-commodified essence of connection. It is the "[social glue]([00_the alchemical shift](obsidian://open?vault=glossary_horse&file=XX_The%20Reclaimed%20End%2F00_the%20alchemical%20shift))" and the raw potentiality of existence.

- **Lore Addition:** "horse" does not have boundaries; it is a flow. When someone feels a shared grief or a collective joy, they are tapping into "horse."

- **Refinement:** If "horse" is the connection between us all, then "not horse" is not necessarily "evil," but rather **stagnation** or **isolation**.
