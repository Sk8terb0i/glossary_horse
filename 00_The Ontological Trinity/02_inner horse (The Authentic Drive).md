- **Definition:** The internal compass. To "gallop" is to act in a way that collapses the distance between your physical self and the universal "horse."

- **Lore Addition:** One does not "own" an inner horse; one _listens_ to it.

- **Refinement:** "Galloping" is a subversive act. In a world of "the horse," galloping is a form of protest.
