### On "the horse" as Commodity**

- **Karl Marx (Capital, Vol. 1):** Specifically the chapter on **Commodity Fetishism**. This explains exactly how the "horse" (the living connection) is transformed into "the horse" (the thing with a price tag).
    
- **Guy Debord (The Society of the Spectacle):** He argues that all of life is now presented as an accumulation of spectacles. "The horse" is a spectacle; "horse" is the reality.
    

### **On "inner horse" and "Galloping"**

- **Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari (A Thousand Plateaus):** They speak of **"Becoming-Animal."** This isn't about literally being an animal, but about finding a "line of flight" to escape the rigid structures of society. "Galloping" is your version of a **Line of Flight**.
    
- **Audre Lorde (The Uses of the Erotic):** She speaks of a "deeply female and spiritual plane" of feeling that acts as a bridge. This aligns perfectly with your "inner horse" as a source of power and truth against oppressive systems.
    

### **On the "Dolphins"**

- **Anatoly Kuznetsov (Animal Farm - Context):** While Orwell used pigs, the concept of a "special position" and the corruption of a collective movement mirrors your Dolphin/Horse dichotomy.
    
- **Donna Haraway (The Companion Species Manifesto):** She explores the relationship between humans and animals, which could help you define the specific "harm" Dolphins do when they sever the "horse/human" bond.

### **On "herd" as Liberated Space**

- **Gilles Deleuze (A Thousand Plateaus):** He speaks about **"The Pack"** versus **"The State."** Your **herd** is the "Pack"—it is metamorphic, moving, and has no fixed hierarchy. It is a "multiplicity."
    
- **Sara Ahmed:** This is the "Social Glue" at its most functional. It is a space where emotions circulate to create a "we" that doesn't erase the "I" of the **inner horse**.
    

### **On "the herd" as Captured Space**

- **Herbert Marcuse (One-Dimensional Man):** He describes how modern society creates a "false consciousness" where people (or horses) feel they are part of a community, but they are actually just being integrated into a system of production. **the herd** is one-dimensional.
    
- **The Panopticon:** In **the herd**, the horses often muzzle each other because they have internalized the Dolphin’s rules.
