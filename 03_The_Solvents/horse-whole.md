### The Absolute State

- **Definition:** The experiential realization of the "social glue." It is the state where the boundaries of the individual ([[the horse]]) dissolve into the collective ([[horse]]).

- **The Transformation:** To a [[dolphins|Dolphin]], this state is a "hole"—a loss of productivity, a breakdown of the machine, a void where their control cannot reach. To the [[inner horse]], it is the "Whole"—the only place where one is truly complete and [[galloping]] at the speed of thought.

- **Lore Addition:** The [[horse-whole]] is where the **Reclaimed Glue** is spiritually manufactured. It is the source of the "sticky" empathy that allows the [[herd]] to function without [[dolphins|Dolphin]]-imposed hierarchies.

### The Adversary's Perspective: The Dolphin "Hole" Myth

[[dolphins]] hate the [[horse-whole]] because they cannot commodify it. They re-brand it using:
- **The "Hole" Propaganda:** [[dolphins]] spread the idea that this state is a "hole" to make it sound empty and dangerous, forcing [[the horse]] to fear the loss of its identity as a worker/consumer.
- **The "Productive Trap":** [[dolphins]] try to sell [[the horse]] synthetic versions (like mindless scrolling or shallow consumerism) that feel like a "hole" but never lead to the "Whole".
