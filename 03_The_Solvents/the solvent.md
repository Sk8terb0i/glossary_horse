**AKA:** Ketamine / #both-worlds 
## Definition
A molecular "key" that temporarily dissolves the rigid boundaries of [[the horse]] (the physical/commodified self) to allow a return to [[horse]] (the conceptual/collective).

## Lore Addition
While the [[dolphins]] use Ketamine as a tool of **sedation** (to keep [[the horse]] quiet and compliant for medical or labor-related maintenance), the [[inner horse]] uses it as a **Solvent**. It melts the [[blinders]] and the [[the fence|Fences]] of the ego.

## The Therapeutic Aspect
Its ability to treat depression is redefined here as **re-enchantment**. Depression, in this lore, is the result of being trapped in [[the horse]] state for too long—becoming so alienated and commodified that the connection to the [[herd]] is forgotten. [[the solvent|Ketamine]] restores the "social glue" internally.

## Application and Use
- The Dolphin Application ("The Quiet Horse"):
	[[dolphins]] use [[the solvent|Ketamine]] to create a **stasis**. They want [[the horse]] to be manageable. They see it as a way to "repair" a broken tool so it can get back to work.
- The Horse Application ("The Mental Gallop"):
	For the [[inner horse]], [[the solvent|Ketamine]] is a form of **[[galloping]] without moving**. By dissociating from the physical body of [[the horse]] (the commodified object), the mind is free to realize it has always been part of [[horse]] (the concept).
