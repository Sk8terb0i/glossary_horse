To resolve the "Horse-on-Horse Conflict," the lore must propose a way to move toward **Bio-Identical/Lab-Grown Estrogen** as a form of **The Reclaimed Factory**.

- **The Reclaimed Synthesis:** Just as we reclaim the Glue Factory, we must reclaim the "Hormone Factory." When estrogen is created without the confinement of the pregnant mare, the "Gallop" is no longer fueled by "The Burden."
    
- **The Unified Neigh:** This allows the trans woman and the mare to stand together in the **herd**. The conflict dissolves because the liberation of one no longer requires the "Muzzle-Blinder" of the other.
