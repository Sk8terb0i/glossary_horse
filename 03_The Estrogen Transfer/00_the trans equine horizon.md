### **The Solvent of the Body (Synthetic/Derived Estrogen)**

- **The Act:** The Dolphin apparatus extracts the life-force (matter) from "the horse" (the pregnant mare) kept in a state of extreme "the herd" confinement.

- **The Symbiosis:** This matter is then refined and given to another being. For a trans woman, this estrogen is the **Chemical Gallop**. It dissolves the "Muzzle-Blinders" of a misaligned body, allowing her "inner horse" to finally run true.

- **The Paradox:** One "inner horse" finds its "gallop" through the literal physical confinement and commodification of another "the horse." It is a beautiful, tragic bridge where the "horse" essence flows through the Dolphin’s machinery to reach someone who needs it to survive.


### **The Horse-on-Horse Conflict**

- **The Dolphin Wedge:** The Dolphins use this transfer to create "Contention." They want the "horse" who receives the estrogen to feel guilt, and the "the horse" who gives it to feel drained.

- **The Strategy:** By making the liberation of one dependent on the exploitation of another, the Dolphins prevent a unified front. They turn a biological gift into a "transactional debt."
