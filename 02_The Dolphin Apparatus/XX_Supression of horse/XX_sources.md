### **On the Fear of the "Heard" (The Herd)**

- **Elias Canetti (Crowds and Power):** Canetti explores how the "stigma of the command" (the Muzzle) creates a burden that can only be shed in a crowd (the Herd). The Dolphins fear the "Discharge"—the moment the Muzzle-Blinders fall and everyone realizes they are "horse."
    
- **Michel Foucault (Discipline and Punish):** He describes **"Panopticism,"** where prisoners (or horses) are kept in a state of conscious and permanent visibility to the master, but are isolated from each other. The Muzzle-Blinders are the portable version of the Panopticon cell.
    

### **On the "Unspeakable" Connection**

- **Sara Ahmed (The Cultural Politics of Emotion):** Ahmed writes about how "walls" are not just physical but affective. The Muzzle-Blinders are **"Affective Walls."** They make the "horse" feel like its struggle is private and shameful, rather than a shared condition of the herd.
    
- **Frantz Fanon (Black Skin, White Masks):** Though writing in a different context, Fanon discusses how the oppressor's language (the Muzzle) forces the oppressed to see themselves through the oppressor's eyes (the Blinders).

## 3. The Counter-Act: "The Collective Neigh"

If the Muzzle-Blinders are the tool of isolation, then the antidote is the **Collective Neigh**.

- **The Collective Neigh:** An auditory "gallop." It is a sound that bypasses the Blinders because it doesn't need to be seen to be felt.
    
- **The Role of Ketamine:** In the **Horse-Whole**, the Muzzle-Blinders dissolve because the "inner horse" no longer perceives the Dolphin's reality. When one returns from the Horse-Whole, they often carry a "Phantom Neigh"—a truth that the Muzzle can no longer fully contain.

### **On "Just Enough" Enrichment**

- **Herbert Marcuse (Repressive Desublimation):** Marcuse argues that capitalism gives people just enough "freedom" and "pleasure" (like social media or small comforts) so they don't feel the need to rebel against the larger system of control. **The Fence** is Repressive Desublimation in physical form.
    
- **Michel Foucault (Biopolitics):** He discusses how power manages populations not just through death, but by "making live and letting die." The Fence is a **Biopolitical Tool**; it manages the horse’s life and sociality to keep it "productive."
    

### **On the Simulation of Connection**

- **Jean Baudrillard (Simulacra and Simulation):** The socialization allowed by the Fence is a **Simulacrum** of "herd." It looks like connection, it feels like connection, but it is actually a curated experience that serves the Dolphin’s economy, not the horse’s soul.
