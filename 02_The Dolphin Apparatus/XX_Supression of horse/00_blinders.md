### **The Isolation Apparatus**

- **Definition:** A dual-purpose sensory cage. The **Blinders** restrict the visual field to the "Project" or the "Paycheck," while the **Muzzle** suppresses the "Neigh"—the frequency of truth that connects one "inner horse" to another.

- **The Dolphin Strategy:** The Dolphins know that a horse is physically stronger than a Dolphin on land. Their only power is **Spatial and Auditory Partitioning**. If "the horse" cannot see its neighbor and cannot hear the collective "gallop," it believes it is an isolated unit of labor.

- **The Result:** The "the" in "the horse" is reinforced. Without the ability to see or speak to the herd, the horse becomes a "Self-Interested Individual," which is the Dolphin's favorite type of "the horse."
