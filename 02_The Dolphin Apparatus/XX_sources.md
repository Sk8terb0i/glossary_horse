### **On the "Elite Horse" and Collaboration**

- **Pierre Bourdieu (Distinction):** He writes about how taste and "high culture" (like Dressage) are used to create social distance and maintain class hierarchies. The "Elite Horse" is a victim of **Symbolic Violence**.

- **Paulo Freire (Pedagogy of the Oppressed):** He discusses how the oppressor (the Dolphin) often uses members of the oppressed group to police their own. The "Elite Horse" believes that by performing for the Dolphin, they are escaping the "herd," not realizing they are just in a prettier cage.

### **On "The Ribbon" as Symbolic Capital**

- **Thorstein Veblen (The Theory of the Leisure Class):** Veblen discusses **"Conspicuous Consumption."** The Elite Horse is essentially a piece of jewelry for the Dolphin. The Ribbon is the price tag that proves the Dolphin’s wealth.

- **Sara Ahmed (The Cultural Politics of Emotion):** We can link the Ribbon to the idea of **"Happiness"** as a disciplinary tool. The Dolphin promises "Happiness" (The Ribbon) if the horse follows a certain "path" (Dressage/Racing).


### **On "The Work Horse" and Alienation**

- **Silvia Federici (Caliban and the Witch):** She discusses how the body was turned into a machine under capitalism. The **Work Horse** is the ultimate representation of the "Body-as-Machine." Their "inner horse" is treated as a fuel source rather than a soul.

- **George Orwell (Animal Farm):** Specifically the character of **Boxer**. Boxer is the quintessential Work Horse who believes that "I will work harder" is the answer, not realizing the Dolphin (or the pigs) will send him to the Glue Factory (Dolphin version) the second he stops being profitable.

### **On the Binary (English vs. Western)**

- **Judith Butler (Gender Trouble):** While she focuses on gender, her theory of **Performativity** applies here. The "English" or "Western" identity is a performance forced upon the horse to give it a "script" that isn't its own. It prevents the "inner horse" from "galloping" its own truth.
