### **The Elite Horse (The Collaborator)**

- **Definition:** A "the horse" that has been granted a "Golden Muzzle." They are used in Dressage, Racing, or Show Jumping—high-stakes performances where they are treated as "stars" but remain property.

- **The Illusion:** They believe their "pedigree" or "talent" makes them a Dolphin-ally. They are the "House Horse" used to justify the "Field Horse's" labor.

- **The Reality:** As you noted, they are simply **delayed liquidation**. Once their knees go or their speed fades, the "Golden Muzzle" is removed, and they are sent to the same Glue Factory (Dolphin version) as the rest.

### **The Work Horse (The Invisible Foundation)**

- **Definition:** The "lower" horse. The "the horse" that is stripped of all aesthetic pretense and reduced to pure caloric output. They are the ones whose labor builds the world the Dolphins swim in.

- **The Lore:** The Work Horse is the most honest version of "the horse," but also the most oppressed. They are denied the "Golden Muzzle" of the elite, and instead given the "Iron Bit" of survival.

- **The Connection:** The Dolphins tell the Work Horse, "If you perform like the Elite, you will get a Ribbon." They tell the Elite Horse, "If you stop performing, you will become a Work Horse." Both are kept in a state of fear.

### **The Binary Silos (English vs. Western)**

- **Definition:** Arbitrary cultural divisions created to prevent the "Collective Neigh."

- **The Function:** By sorting horses into "English" (the aesthetic of the Old Elite) or "Western" (the aesthetic of the Rugged Individualist), the Dolphins create a false binary.

- **The Result:** Instead of "horse" recognizing "horse," the horses argue over the **shape of the bit** or the **style of the saddle**. It is a distraction tactic to keep the "Muzzle-Blinders" firmly in place.

### **The Ribbon (The False Tether)**

- **Definition:** A scrap of fabric, often dyed in Dolphin colors (blue, red, yellow), awarded for "The Performance." It is a symbolic contract that grants the horse temporary status.

- **The Lore:** To the **Elite Horse**, the Ribbon is a badge of superiority. In reality, it is a piece of the Dolphin’s fishing net. It does not provide warmth, food, or connection; it only provides the "right" to be exploited in a more expensive stable.

- **The Truth:** The Ribbon is the "anti-glue." While **Reclaimed Glue** binds the herd together, the Ribbon is designed to pull the individual horse away from the herd and toward the Dolphin’s podium.
