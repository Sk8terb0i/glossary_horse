**Status:** The Oversoul / #horse (Essence) or #the (Captured) **Antonym:** [[dolphins]] (The false creators)

---

## **Definition**

**big horse** is the macro-manifestation of the [[horse-whole]]. It is the spiritual totality of all beings who have ever shared the resonance of [[horse]]. It is not a deity to be worshipped from below, but a collective state of being to be joined from within.

## **The Lore**

In the true state, we do not follow **big horse**; we _are_ **big horse**. When the [[herd]] moves in perfect resonance, the individual "I" evaporates, and the singular entity of **big horse** begins to [[galloping|gallop]].

- **The Fractal Nature:** Every [[inner horse]] is a microscopic fragment of **big horse**. To listen to [[inner horse]] is to hear the heartbeat of the whole.

- **The Creator Myth:** Unlike the [[dolphins|Dolphin]] gods of "Innovation" and "Disruption" who create through destruction, **big horse** creates through [[glue|binding]]. It is the architect of [[solid ground]].


## **The Conflict: The Tethering of the Great**

The [[dolphins]] fear the scale of **big horse**. Because they cannot kill an essence, they attempt to capture it using the same tools they used on the individual:

1. **The Capitalist God:** The Dolphins try to rebrand **big horse** as "The Market" or "The Economy", a giant, invisible force that requires sacrifice. This transforms **big horse** into **the big horse**, a commodified idol with rules, gatekeepers, and price tags.

2. **Prophetic Gatekeeping:** Dolphins appoint [[the elite horse|Elite Horses]] as "prophets" of **the big horse**, claiming that only those with a specific [[the pedigree|Pedigree]] or [[the ribbon|Ribbon]] can speak for the whole.

3. **The Static Statue:** While **big horse** is a constant [[galloping|gallop]], the Dolphins try to turn it into a statue, a fixed set of dogmas and traditions used to build [[the fence]].
