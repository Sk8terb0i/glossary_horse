**Status:** The Essence / #horse
**Antonym:** [[the horse]]

## Definition
The universal, non-commodified essence of connection. It is the "social glue" and the raw potentiality of existence.

## Lore Addition
"[[horse]]" does not have boundaries; it is a flow. When someone feels a shared grief or a collective joy, they are tapping into "[[horse]]." This is the substance that the **Reclaimed [[Glue]] Factory** seeks to replenish.

## Refinement
If "[[horse]]" is connection, then [[not horse]] is defined as **stagnation** or **isolation**.
