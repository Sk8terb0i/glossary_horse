## **Ethical Hedonism**

In world of [[horse]], pleasure is not a luxury; it is a metric of truth.

- **Definition:** Pursuit of joy that does not require exploitation of another's [[inner horse]].
    
- **Dolphin Contrast:** [[dolphins]] offer "Cheap Hedonism", consumption that leaves soul empty and [[the flood]] rising. **Ethical Hedonism** is joy found in [[galloping]], [[herd]], and sun on [[solid ground]].
    

## **Three Fs of horse**

These are non-negotiable requirements for [[horse]] life. When a Dolphin removes one, [[horse]] begins to transform into [[the horse]].

### 1. Foraging

- **Essence:** Right to seek what sustains soul without being fed "rations" by [[dolphins]].
    
- **Lore:** In [[the herd]], you are given a bucket of grain (a paycheck) so you stay near gate. In [[herd]], you forage for truth across vastness of [[solid ground]].
    

### 2. Friends

- **Essence:** True, unmediated connection.
    
- **Lore:** [[the fence]] allows for "acquaintances" or "coworkers." [[horse]] requires **Friends**, social [[glue]] that creates resonance and [[collective neigh]].
    

### 3. Freedom

- **Essence:** Ability to [[galloping|gallop]] without a destination.
    
- **Lore:** [[dolphins]] offer "Choice" (which brand of [[blinders]] to wear). [[horse]] demands **Freedom**, total absence of [[the fence]] and iron bit.
