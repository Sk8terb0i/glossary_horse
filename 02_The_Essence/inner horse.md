**Status:** The Compass

## Definition
The internal compass. One does not "own" an inner horse; one *listens* to it.

## Lore Addition: [[galloping]]
To "gallop" is to act in a way that collapses the distance between the physical self and the universal [[horse]].

## Refinement
"Galloping" is a subversive act and a form of protest against the world of [[the horse]].
