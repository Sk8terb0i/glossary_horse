# reclaimed factory
**Status:** The Means of Production

## Definition
The site where the matter of [[the horse]] is seized and turned back into the [[glue]] of [[horse]].

## The Glue Factory (Reclaimed)
The transformation of "dead labor" into "living connection."

- **Dolphin Version:** A site of terminal alienation. Once [[the horse]] is spent and can no longer labor or be sold, it is liquidated. The glue produced here is used to build the Dolphins' high-rises and luxury goods—it is "sticky" only to keep the Dolphin structures standing.
- **Horse Version:** The site of **Transubstantiation**. It is a sacred space where the physical remains of "the horse" (the individual) are processed with dignity to become the bond that holds the [[horse]] (the collective) together. It is where the physical is returned to the essence.
