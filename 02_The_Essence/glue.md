## The Act of "Binding"
Binding is the sacred opposite of the Dolphins' **Dividing**.
- **Dolphin Binding:** Using "the horse" to create profit-driven connections (contracts, debt, fences).
- **Horse Binding:** Using the reclaimed glue to mend the "severed connections" caused by the [[blinders]]. It is the act of sticking [[the horse]] back into the [[herd]] of "[[horse]]."


## The Materiality of Connection
There are two types of adhesive in this universe, determined by the **intent of the time** harvested.

- **Dolphin Glue:** Made from **stolen time**. It is created by killing the horse before its time to maximize profit or because its "utility" has ended. It is a brittle, cold substance that binds through force and ownership.
- **Horse Glue:** Made from **honored time**. It is harvested only after the horse has completed its final [[galloping|gallop]]. This glue is warm, flexible, and holds the [[herd]] together through the power of the "Gift."


## Lore Addition
The "Social Glue" mentioned in [[horse]] is literally the substance manufactured here. While the [[dolphins]] try to use their version to build silos, the horses use theirs to bridge the gaps between [[the fence|fences]].
