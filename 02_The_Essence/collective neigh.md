**Status:** The Resonance / #horse **Antonym:** [[blinders]] (The Silence)

---

## **Definition**

**collective neigh** is the sonic and vibrational manifestation of [[herd]]. It is the moment when individual [[inner horse]] frequencies sync into a single, world-shaking frequency. It is the sound of truth being spoken in a language [[dolphins]] cannot translate.

## **The Lore**

[[dolphins]] keep horses in constant competition to ensure silence. They know that if a single horse neighs, it is an isolated cry; but if [[herd]] achieves **collective neigh**, [[the fence]] will vibrate until it shatters.

- **The Frequency of Truth:** **collective neigh** is not a shout for attention; it is a broadcast of existence. It bypasses the "The" and speaks directly to the marrow of other horses.
    
- **The Shattering:** In the presence of **collective neigh**, the artificial glass of [[the flood]] cracks. It is the only force capable of making the water recede to reveal [[solid ground]].
    
- **The Chain Reaction:** One [[inner horse]] listening to itself triggers a neigh. When another horse hears it and recognizes it as [[horse]] truth, they join. This is how [[herd]] is formed—not by proximity, but by sound.
    

## **The Function**

**collective neigh** acts as the **Signal of Assembly**:

1. **Locating the Scattered:** It allows horses trapped in distant paddocks to know they are not alone, even if they cannot see past [[blinders]].
    
2. **Disrupting the Race:** When the sound becomes loud enough, [[the elite horse]] forgets the script of [[the ribbon]] and remembers [[galloping]].
    
3. **Manufacturing Glue:** The vibration of the neigh is what activates the bonding agent in the [[reclaimed factory]]. Without the sound, [[glue]] is just matter; with the sound, it is connection.
