## **Definition**

**ethical hedonism** is the practice of prioritizing joy, comfort, and sensory satisfaction as a radical act of resistance. It is the understanding that within the world of [[horse]], pleasure is the primary metric of truth and the only sustainable fuel for [[galloping]].

## **The Lore**

[[dolphins]] have spent centuries convincing us that "work" is a virtue and "suffering" is a badge of honor. They created [[the work horse]] to glorify exhaustion. **ethical hedonism** is the cure to this sickness—it is the reclamation of the right to feel good without permission.

- **Joy as Compass:** If an action leads to a deeper connection with [[inner horse]] and [[herd]], it is ethical. If it leads to the burnout of the spirit, it is a Dolphin trap.
    
- **The Refusal of Guilt:** Under [[the flood]], pleasure is often framed as "guilty." In the light of [[horse]], guilt is merely a social muzzle. There is no guilt in [[foraging]] for what makes the heart beat faster.
    
- **Sustainability of Spirit:** A horse that does not experience joy cannot maintain [[galloping]]. **ethical hedonism** ensures that the fire of [[inner horse]] never goes out.
    

## **The Practice**

- **Active Foraging:** Seeking out specific flavors, sounds, and textures that resonate with essence (e.g., [[horse|McDonalds Fries]] or [[horse|Smirnoff Ice]]).
    
- **Radical Rest:** Rejecting the Dolphin-mandated "hustle" in favor of the restorative stillness of [[solid ground]].
    
- **Shared Ecstasy:** Engaging in rituals that trigger [[collective neigh]], where the joy of the individual amplifies the joy of [[herd]].
